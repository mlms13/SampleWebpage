SampleWebpage
=============

I started building this simple single-page website for a customer in March. After it became clear that they had no plans to pay me, I decided not to give them the website and instead give it away on the internet.

There's nothing too revolutionary going on here, but I didn't want to waste one of my private repositories on this customer, so I stripped out their contact info and images.  There are several improvements I'd like to make, but let's be honest, this isn't exactly a high priority.
